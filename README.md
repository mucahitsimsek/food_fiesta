# Figma
[Advance to Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/LQhk53Zfj03aOg6Z2Y1OMg/Food-App?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=4mlpn1vqkTgpjQtf-0)

I chose this ready-made template because it is designed in a way that is conducive to the development of a real project. Therefore, it was my preference.

# TODO LIST

- UI should be created efficiently and performantly.
- Bloc Pattern will be preferred for State Management.
- <s>For backend development, consideration and selection among Firebase, Node.JS, ASP.NET, and GO options are necessary.</s>
  - Firebase Realtime Database was selected for database, and Firebase Auth was selected for auth. Developments will be built with Firebase REST API.
